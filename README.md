This application, StreamlitSketchR, is a fun project that allows users to convert uploaded images into magical sketches using the Streamlit framework and the Python programming language. It utilizes the following modules:
- Streamlit for creating the interactive web application.
- PIL (Python Imaging Library) for image processing.
- "Still in development, I'm striving to enhance the code quality; it represents the initial version of the app."
## How It Works
1. Users can upload an image in PNG, JPEG, or JPG format.
2. Click the "Sketch Me" button to generate a magical sketch based on the uploaded image.
3. The generated sketch will be displayed on the web page along with a download button.
4. Users can click the download button to save the sketch as a PNG file on their device.
